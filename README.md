# COMP 251 Algorithms and Data Structures Fall 2020
Algorithms and Data Structures coursework in Java at McGill University.

## **Final Project** - 2020 US Election Statistics Algorithm
In this project, an algorithm is designed to predict if Biden has chance to win and what is the minimum number of people that he would have to convince to earn the US presidency. In this algorithm, the number of three kinds of people are given, they are:
1. People who will definitely vote for Trump.
2. People who will definitely vote for Biden.
3. People who has not decided whom to vote for.

In this election, the one who wins more people in the same state will win the number of votes that equal to the number of delegates for that state.

## **Project 1** - Building a Hash Table
In this project, a Hash Table is designed. Furthermore, the perofromance of the Hash tables implemented using chaining and open addressing are compared in this project.

## **Project 2** - Algorithms Designs
In this project, 3 algorithms are designed and they are:
- Disjoint Sets
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) 
- Greedy Algorithms

## **Project 3** - Graph Algorithms Designs
In this project, 2 algorithms related to graph are designed and they are:
- **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm:** This is implemented to calculate the Maximum Flow of a directed weighted graph.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** This is implemented to finding the shortest path in a graph where edges can have negative weights.
