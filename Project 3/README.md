# ECSE 427 Project 3 (Fall 2020)

## Description
In this project, 2 algorithms related to graph are designed and they are:
- **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm:** This is implemented to calculate the Maximum Flow of a directed weighted graph.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** This is implemented to finding the shortest path in a graph where edges can have negative weights.
